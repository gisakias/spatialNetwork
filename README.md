# spatialNetwork  
<b>Spatial Network Solution</b> is an advanced visualization and analysis tool designed for spatial networks, focusing on real-world geographic and network data.
The application enables users to explore relationships between nodes and edges in a network context, offering insights into 
connectivity, distance metrics, and spatial clustering.

Key features include:

* <b>Interactive Visualization</b>: Dynamic mapping of nodes, edges, and spatial relationships with adjustable parameters.
* <b>Custom Network Operations</b>: Clipping spatial networks with bounding polygons, nearest edge identification, and
*  interactive geometry overlays.
* <b>Integrated Data Processing</b>: Utilizes robust R packages like sf and goal for managing and visualizing spatial features.
* <b>Use Case Demonstrations</b>: Pre-configured examples such as analyzing the road networks and evacuation points
*  within defined bounding boxes (e.g., Chania city).

This tool is ideal for urban planners, geospatial analysts, and researchers aiming to extract actionable insights from complex spatial networks.
